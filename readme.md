# Feature Engineering and Outlier Detection

This project implements feature engineering techniques and outlier detection methods inspired by the Kaggle notebook by [Dhanisha](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhanishahahaha/feature-engineering-outliers).

## Overview

The notebook focuses on:

- Feature transformation and engineering
- Handling skewed data
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Preparing data for model building

These techniques are commonly used in preprocessing steps for data science and machine learning projects to improve model performance and robustness.
